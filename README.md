# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and automated installation scripts for various projects and tools. This repository allows for quick and consistent environment setup across different machines.

## Current Configurations

Currently, this repository provides configurations for the following:

- Fish Shell

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git`
2. Navigate into the repository: `cd dotfiles`
3. Run the global installation script: `sh install.sh`

The `install.sh` script will go through all the projects and run their individual installation scripts, setting up configurations as needed.

## Projects

### Fish Shell

The Fish Shell is a smart and user-friendly command line shell for macOS, Linux, and the rest of the family. My custom configurations can be found in the 'fish' directory.
